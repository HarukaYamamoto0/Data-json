# Data-json
a simple database
just to be clear, this project is just a challenge i made for myself, first i will build the database using key and value architecture, then i will increase the difficulty.

I'm going to use the simpl.db package, created by 5antos, as a base, so as I said I'm going to increase the difficulty, my goal, and get as close as possible to the mongoose package.

I don't intend to gain anything from it, as I said, it's just a challenge.
